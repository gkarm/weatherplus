                        Our interactive map allows users to view weather patterns in
                        real-time. Built with semantic HTML and responsive design in mind,
                        the map ensures accessibility across all devices. Using Flexbox, the
                        map adjusts seamlessly, and media queries optimize the experience
                        for smaller screens.

                        Responsiveness is key in modern web apps. By applying a mobile-first
                        approach, we ensure that the navbar, signup form, and forecast pages
                        look great on both phones and desktops. Flexbox provides alignment
                        and spacing that adapts dynamically without breaking layouts.

                        Our signup and login forms are styled with SCSS and follow
                        responsive practices. Inputs expand naturally on smaller screens,
                        while clear contrast and hover effects improve user experience.
                        Using semantic HTML tags like <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> and{" "}
                        <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> makes the app accessible for screen
                        readers.

                        The weather forecasts are structured in a grid layout for clarity.
                        Each card uses relative units (rem, %) instead of fixed pixels,
                        ensuring smooth scaling. This keeps content readable and usable on
                        any device, from wide monitors to compact phones.
